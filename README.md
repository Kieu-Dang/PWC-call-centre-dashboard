This is a part of the PWC job simulation on using Power BI.
I generated a 2 pages dashboard reflecting the overall performance and a breakdown by agents.

Based on the dashboard, I accumulated the following insights:
1. Abandoned rate is at 19%, which is relatively high and suggests that customers may be dropping calls due to long wait times.
2. Overall satisfaction rate is at 3.4 and does not vary among agents. There's about 20% of rating at 1 and 2 which reflect a room for improvements.
3. Peak hours are on Monday, Saturday and between 11am to 3pm

Here are some suggestions for call centre managers: 
Reduce Abandoned Calls:

1. Implement callback options or chat alternatives.
- Distribute calls efficiently among available agents.
- Optimize Agent Scheduling:

2. Assign more agents during 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM to match high call volumes.
- Stagger break times to ensure coverage during peak hours.
- Improve Customer Satisfaction:

3. Address long waiting times by improving queue management.
- Offer additional training to agents with lower CSAT scores.
- Identify common complaints in streaming and technical support calls to provide better scripts or automated solutions.
- Enhance Resolution Rate:

4. Agents with lower resolution rates (e.g., Joe) may need additional coaching or access to better knowledge bases.
- Encourage agents to reduce call handling times without compromising quality.
